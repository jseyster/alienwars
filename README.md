Alien Wars
==========

Alien Wars is a game I wrote in high school for a physics web site I
planned to design with a friend of mine.  The web site never got off
the ground, but eventually, I decided that the world should still get
a chance to see Alien Wars.

It is possible that I decided rashly.

You might be familar with the game Gorillas, that came as an example
with the original QBasic.

This game is that but with way cooler graphics (all drawn by my
partner in crime for that physics web site).

If you're not familiar with Gorillas, then I will ask you to kindly
GET OFF MY LAWN.

Build
=====

The script build.sh builds the game sources and archives them in a JAR
file.  There is also an example HTML file that shows how to embed the
JAR file as an applet.
