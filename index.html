<h3>Alien Wars</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alien Wars is a game for two players at the same computer.  It's a little something I cooked up back when I was in high school over the course of about a week.  I was pretty bored.  Eventually, while I was in college, I decided to make a web site for it so that I could show it off.  Now, the site is preserved on GitHub, along with all the dated humor, which I have left intact.  It wasn't really funny back then, either.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game Is far from perfect, but it can be fun to play.  Somebody once offered me a dollar for a copy, which I thought was quite a compliment!  I didn't accept the dollar, but I have come to regret that, as it would have allowed me to make a twenty minute phone call with 10-10-220.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I wrote this in high school, the source code is a disaster area.  Nonetheless, I decided to do the right thing and post all of it on GitHub for your amusement.  You can get the code from the <a href="https://github.com/jseyster/alienwars">Alien Wars</a> project page.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The images are mine, except for the buildings, which were designed by my friend Edmond.
<br><br><h3>Instructions</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once all the images have loaded, just click the applet to get going.  Player one starts, and the game alternates between players.  Use the up and down buttons to adjust your firing angle and the left and right buttons to adjust initial velocity.  Once you have settings that you like, press space to fire your goo cannon.  The cannon will fire, and control will be switched to player two.  Player two has the same controls as player one.  The game ends once one of the players gets hit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the special goo explosive will not detonate unless it hits a building.  This means that, in order to win, you must cause the goo to land at your opponent's feet.  This is what Microsoft would refer to as a "feature."
<br><h3>Story</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year: 2856.  The place: a far away post-apocolyptic alien world, ravaged by millennia of nuclear warfare, as well as every other science fiction cliche I could think to put in.  Only few remain of a once proud alien race, and those few are forced to compete for the scarce remaining resources on their shattered homeworld.  Standing atop the blackened skylines that litter their devestated planet, the aliens battle it out, firing on each other with their deadly nuclear-goo cannons.  In <i>Alien Wars</i>(tm) you play a green blob who is forced to remove any threat to his continuing survival. The rules are simple: every person eliminated is one less person with which you have to compete for food.  It may seem harsh, but on this world, it's every blob for himself.
<br><br><h3>Features</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, <i>Alien Wars</i>(tm) is poised to take the gaming world by storm.  Here are some of the features that have excited game players talking:
<ul>
	<li>Exciting head-to-head multiplay with only one computer</li>
	<li>Beatiful 256-color graphics</li>
	<li>Realistic physics engine accurately models parabolic missile trajectories in absence of air and wind resistance</li>
	<li>Dynamically destroyable terrain wtih revolutionary AlienMod terrain modification engine</li>
	<li>Technology developed at Sun Microsystems allows <i>Alien Wars</i>(tm) to be delivered across platforms over the Internet for a rich gaming experience on almost any computer
</ul>
